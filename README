I wanted to learn something about redis so I did up this simple forum that uses only redis (no db/sql).  Still pretty rough in spots

Findings:

* without activerecord - you'll have to roll your own error handling for models
* you can't use form_for on new objects

To Do:
* add destroy functionality to Remodel (currently deleting something like a forum leaves topics and posts under it)
* add validation functionality to Remodel
* figure out how to do paging with redis
* add tests for changes to remodel

To get started...

1. find latest redis on redis.googlecode.com
2. follow these instructions
3. sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/redis-server
4. cd /usr/bin && sudo ./redis-server
5. sudo gem install yajl-ruby
6. script/console
7. Dummy.new.gen_data  WARNING this nukes your redis file


This is currently working off a modified fork of Remodel that's not ready for a pull request: git://github.com/wiseleyb/remodel.git
